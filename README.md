Homework 2 / Road Rage

Winter 2025

## Assignment Overview
This assignment was meant to give students a better understanding of backend
programming and how to use polymorphisms to implement classes with similar behavior.
It focused on testing and implementation on the backend, and did not involve any student
implementation on the front end of the program.

## Technical Impression:

During the course of the assignment, more was learned about the functioning and use of record 
classes in Java to store starting state in the AbstractVehicle class and test cases in the various
 unit testing modules. One difficulty that was experienced early in the project was how to determine
  if a vehicle was alive or dead, while attempting to reduce redundancies in the code. Upon the 
  first try, all vehicles displayed as if they were dead, but all behaved normally (dying and 
  reviving as expected behaviorally). After fixing that issue, all vehicles displayed as if they were
   alive, even if they were stopped and exhibiting behavior consistent with dying and reviving. The 
   most trivial problem encountered during the programming of this assignment was also the one that 
   took the longest to debug, which was during writing the Bicycle test class when attempting to write
    out all the correct selections of the chooseDirection method. A small mistake was made wherein 
    East and West were thought to be right and left, respectively, instead of the reverse, and this 
    resulted in twenty minutes of analysis of the testing class and the Bicycle class before identifying
     that the problem was unrelated to the code written.
While some code coverage information was gleaned by manually adjusting which packages the code coverage 
tool analyzed for each unit test module created, it often gave little more insight than simply hand-checking 
that each method in the class of interest had a corresponding test method in the unit test module.
